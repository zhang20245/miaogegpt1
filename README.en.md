## ⚡ Quick Start

I have redefined the variables after `@` in `CUSTOM_MODELS`. For example, previously you could use `gpt-4o@OpenAI`, where `OpenAI` served as the provider and constrained the request format to OpenAI. However, as more models adopt the OpenAI format as the standard, using `@openai` became awkward and caused issues. Now, in my version, I recommend using `@model_category` to constrain the model. (The original method is still supported, but the `@` usage has been expanded.)

> You don’t need to do this manually; the client automatically handles the configuration. I simply recommend setting the variable on the server side with `@model_category`. Future updates will focus on this category.
